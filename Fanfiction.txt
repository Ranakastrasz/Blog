I spent a lot of my free time reading for a long time. Physical books, since it wasn't until much later than I found online stories. 

My first encounter I remember with fanfiction was the Animorphs Series. I was obsessed with it for a long time. I had all the books, reread them, and so on. I wanted to find more, and did some research, found out that some people wrote continuations or short stories in that universe. This didn't last that long. There weren't a lot of them, and I lost interest after a while.

Much later, once I got into My Little Pony, I watched my way through all the episodes at that time. When I ran out, I tried to find more My Little Pony content. Images, discussion, and so on. I believe that is when I found Fimfiction. For a while, I just read stories on the site, waiting for new episodes.

Thing is, this is when I slowly learned that writing quality varies far more than I previously knew. With normal books, generally I just find something that looks interesting, and read it. Back then, I really didn't have much in the way of filters, so I would read pretty much any story I found. Most of which, thinking back on, really were terrible.

I registered later, Don't recall why specifically. It might have been to comment on a story, or to use tracking features.

I had obtained an Ebook Reader, a Nook, which I could take to school and read during freetime. Thing was, it didn't have internet, and you had to buy the majority of books you might want to read. Did that for a few, but I found out that it was possible to add ebooks manually to it. I found a program, Calbre, and spent a lot of time using that to read stories.
