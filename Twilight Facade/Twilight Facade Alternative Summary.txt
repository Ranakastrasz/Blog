Twilight Sparkle is frustrated that Princess Celestia has sent her to Ponyville instead of allowing her to focus on more critical research concerning Nightmare Moon's potential return. During a carriage ride with Spike, she suddenly experiences a loss of control over her body, suspecting she's under some form of mind control or attack. Despite her efforts to dispel it, she remains unable to regain control, all while Spike cheerfully reads Celestia's letter urging Twilight to make friends, adding to her frustration and sense of helplessness.

Twilight finds herself in Ponyville under mysterious mind control, unable to act on her own. She speculates that Nightmare Moon might be behind the attack, aiming to ambush Princess Celestia during the upcoming Summer Sun Celebration. Despite her panic, Spike remains oblivious, eagerly guiding the unknown controller through their tasks. They encounter Pinkie Pie, who reacts strangely and quickly flees. Twilight's attempts to signal Spike about her predicament go unnoticed as they proceed with preparations, beginning with Sweet Apple Acres.

Twilight, still under mind control, struggles with walking and repeatedly shouts "JET-LAG!" as she stumbles. They arrive at Sweet Apple Acres, where Applejack enthusiastically greets them and offers a sample of the Celebration's food. Twilight, now believing herself controlled by Nightmare Moon, hesitates but eventually indulges in the apple-based dishes, finding them surprisingly delicious. Applejack introduces her family amidst the chaotic meal, including Big Macintosh, Apple Bloom, and Granny Smith. As conversation turns to origins, Twilight awkwardly discusses Fillydelphia, though her responses are likely fabricated due to her lack of control. The focus shifts to learning about Ponyville from Applejack.

--- problematic. Summery isn't managing to discriminate between controller or controllee. Ofc I had trouble like this writing it, so ye.
