While mostly for My Little Pony Human in Equestria Fanfiction, it also applies to other works of fiction.

Different flavors

Human from Earth
    - Essentially, either author avatar or audience surigate. Very common.
Human from Earth with Knowledge of show. - Subgroup of how literal the show is. Broad strokes vs absolutely correct in all respects, ignoring contractions in show and so on.
    - Far more relatable audience surragate. After all, you watched the show, didn't you? Also very common.
Human from Elsewhere, or Nonhumans 
    - Humans from elsewhere, like another work of fiction, or nonhumans, like Elves or keldarians (Memory Pending) can also be interesting.
    - Either a crossover with another work or original setting. 
        Uncommon.
Polymorph, y/n

If not polymorphed, you lose most of your options. If you are, then you keep all of them.
After all, you still physically look like a human, so 


    
If they have no knowledge of the show, it is pretty straightforward.

That said, some of the options still exist.

Keep it all a secret.
Generally motivated by
-fear of immoral scientists
    -Yea, real, modern scientists are probably not like this, but first of all, you are in a new world with an entirely different culture, and second of all, our popular culture makes this seem really, really probable.
-Fear of disrupting the timeline
    -This works way too well, way too often, and honestly is boring. Far more fun to alter the timeline accidently because of butterflies.
    -That said, it is justifiable, given how often split-second saves occur, and how any alternation could result in end of the world sceneros. 
-Fear of Racism.
    -MLP specific is highly reasonable, The Ponies are pretty xenophobic, its actually impressive.
        Some people might not want to be friends with an alien, or worse, a crazy person, see disbelief.
-Fear of Death.
    -Generally a end result of the rest of them one way or another.

If it comes out later, this can make it worse, or be fully justified.

Keep it a secret
    - A common approach. 
Reveal minor
    -From knowing general information about the world. Common knolwedge. Still has issues with secrets, but is less suspcious than "Amnesia" cliche, that nobody should believe.
Meta Precog/Time travel 
    -Reveal information as though from such a source. May cause problems, but kinda accurate.
Meta Scrying
    -You watched them, literally. Has the obvious "Why are you in my bedroom watching me sleep" issue though, but again, kinda accurate
Meta Fiction
    -Yep, you are all fictional characters. Queue Exticential Horror. 
Metafictional Precognition
    -You explain fully, that you watched the show/read the book, it reveals a bunch of stuff that matches up with your current reality, and that they can be fictional since you are there observing them and they literally exist, and that the works of fiction were probably written by a time traveler or seer or something.
   
How you might react to start with.

I am totally ripping this from "Wish upon a Supernova" because it formed the basis of my beliefs.

        Scenario A: Memories True, Senses Deceived

        Conclusion: I was still human, but somehow I was perceiving the world through a warped filter. The apparent self-consistency of the distortion leads to the possibility that my own actions would be seen as normal to those around me if they were normal in the perceived world's rules. Although that would be a jury-rigged solution at best, it would allow me to function, albeit uncomfortably.

        Course of Action: Play along, freak out internally.

        Scenario B: Memories False, Senses True

        Conclusion: The world has never been how I remembered. If everything I had experienced before was at best partially fictitious, then how could I trust myself? New memories seem to be consistent with perception, which leaves the possibility of rebuilding 'correct' memories in the future.

        Course of Action: Ignore past, freak out internally.

        Scenario C: Memories True, Senses True

        Conclusion: This doesn't even seem possible in the slightest. Mental breakdown is much more likely than a combined physical transformation and extreme relocation to a potentially alternate reality. However, since this scenario shifts all blame away from a possible problem with the subject it makes sense that this would be the preferred belief for many victims of mental disorders.

        Course of Action: Freak out internally.

        Scenario D: Memories False, Senses Deceived

        Conclusion: Herein lies madness.

        Course of Action: Freak out externally.

Each of these are how you might react. The majority of them seem to just go with Scenerio C.


How they React to the reveal.

They believe you
    - Depressingly the most common one, and hence the least interesting. Yep, I was a human, am now a pony. I believe you unconditionally. Sometimes there is at least an excuse, like mindreading or "Technobabble/Magibabble" evidence for the transition. But still, not that interesting.
They Partially believe you
    - I can't actually think of any examples. It seems to be always polarized.
They disbelive you.
    - Human in Equestria? We have dismissed these Claims. You are Lying. Or your memories have been altered. Or you are just crazy. I don't believe you, it is rediculous.
