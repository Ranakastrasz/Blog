You are a Kitten in a Catnip forest.
Or rather, I am. Its a fun life, exploring the tall trees and nibbling on the catnip growths.
Playing in the river, finding shiny rocks, and overall enjoying life.

One day, I found a really shiny rock. it glittered, and shimmered, and looked kinda like if a rainbow got trapped inside and twisted up. It was connected by some kind of string to a bunch of other rocks like it. The whole thing was fun to play with, until It attacked me. It got stuck around my neck, and I couldn't untangle myself.
