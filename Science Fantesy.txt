One of my favorite Genres of Stories is Science Fantasy. Which is to say, stories that combine Science Fiction and Fantasy Elements, or at least modern and Fantasy elements.

Several book series got me into this type of story. Larry Niven's "The Magic Goes Away" universe had some elements of this. It looks like a traditional swords and sorcery world, except that Warlock figured out that magic was a finite resource using a legitimate scientific experiment. This secret, once it gets out, triggers a collapse of civilization. <>
That their plan involves trying to drop the moon on the planet (and making sure it doesn't fall into the ocean, and end up lost) results in a great quest that ends in them discovering just how large the moon is, and exactly how bad the results will be if they cannot abort the process.

The Young Wizards book series has more elements of this. While the first two books have some of this, the third involves using magic to teleport between planets, and meeting alien races, creating an AI race of Wizards in the process.


The main reason I have kept with My Little Pony fanfiction so long is the sheer number of Science fantasy stories.
Sure, you can get these from any old crossover that involves Fantasy and Science Fiction. But the rediculous number of fanfictions for My Little pony results in a far larger quantity.
Thanks to the main character, Twilight Sparkle, being a Scientist (Albiet a fake, Hollywood varient) and other factors, the result is that people tend towards imagining what the MLP universe might look like in the future, just like Science fiction is what our world might look like in the future.
