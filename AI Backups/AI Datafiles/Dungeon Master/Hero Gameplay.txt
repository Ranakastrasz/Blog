Certainly. I'll compile the hero path and mechanics into an organized, bulleted list for easy reference and entry into the knowledge base. Here it is:

Hero Mechanics and Progression:

1. Hero Types:
   - Martial: No mana, uses cooldowns and/or charges
   - Caster: Uses mana system alongside cooldowns and/or charges

2. Hero Selection:
   - Wide variety of heroes available, comparable to MOBA diversity
   - Selected at game start

3. Stats and Resources:
   - No traditional attributes (Strength/Agility/Intelligence)
   - Only raw stats
   - Resource system varies by hero type (cooldowns, charges, mana)

4. Abilities:
   - 5 total abilities per hero
     - 4 normal skills
     - 1 ultimate skill
   - Each ability has 5 tiers

5. Leveling System:
   - Start at level 1 with 1 skill point
   - Gain 1 skill point per level
   - Typical level progression:
     - Stage 1: Levels 8-10
     - Stage 2: Levels 14-16
     - Stage 3: Levels 20-22

6. Skill Point Allocation:
   - Normal skills: Can be upgraded at levels 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
   - Ultimate skill: Can be upgraded at levels 6, 8, 10, 12, 14
   - Cannot max all abilities (25 total tiers, but max level ~22)

7. Gameplay Path:
   a. Start in town/shop area
   b. Navigate through branching paths with obstacles and terrain features
   c. Fight through regular enemies
   d. Defeat 5 mini-bosses per stage
   e. Confront and defeat stage boss
   f. Return to shop for next stage
   g. Repeat for 3 total stages, with increasing difficulty

8. Combat Mechanics:
   - Line of sight affected by terrain
   - Some heroes can jump/teleport/fly over obstacles
   - High ground advantage for vision

9. Progression Rewards:
   - Kills provide global XP and money share to all heroes
   - Mini-bosses give large XP rewards, often enough for a level up

10. Strategic Elements:
    - Constant pressure to push forward
    - Balancing time spent on mini-bosses vs. regular progression
    - Team composition importance
    - Long-term skill allocation planning across all stages

11. Resurrection:
    - Healer classes gain resurrection ability at level 6

This list encapsulates the key aspects of hero mechanics and progression in the game, providing a comprehensive overview for reference and knowledge base entry.
