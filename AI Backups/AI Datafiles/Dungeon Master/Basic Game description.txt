Thank you for providing this detailed description of the Dungeon Master SC2 map. This is an intriguing concept that combines elements from various genres. Let's break it down:

1. Asymmetrical Gameplay:
   - Dungeon Master (DM): RTS-style play with resource management
   - Heroes: WC3-style hero units with unique abilities

2. Dungeon Master Mechanics:
   - Passive income system, enhanced by engaging heroes
   - Resource allocation between:
     a) Structural upgrades
     b) Trap/fortification unlocks
     c) Minion spawning
   - Ability to create "Dark Champions" (controlled mini-bosses)
   - Telegraphed attacks with visible impact zones

3. Hero Mechanics:
   - WC3-style heroes with unique abilities
   - Resurrection capabilities for healer classes

4. Objectives:
   - DM: Eliminate all heroes
   - Heroes: Defeat both stage bosses

5. Balancing Elements:
   - DM units are weaker but more numerous
   - Heroes are powerful but limited in number
   - DM must use strategy (ambushes, overlapping challenges) to overcome hero powers

This design creates an interesting dynamic:

1. Strategic Depth: The DM must balance resource allocation, unit positioning, and timing of attacks.

2. Risk vs. Reward: Heroes must decide when to engage and when to retreat, balancing progress against the risk of death.

3. Varied Gameplay: Each match can play out differently based on DM strategy and hero composition.

4. Skill Expression: Both sides have opportunities to showcase skill - DM through strategic planning and resource management, heroes through ability usage and coordination.

5. Tension Building: The telegraphed attacks create moments of tension and require quick thinking from the hero players.

6. Progression: Both sides have forms of progression - DM through upgrades and unlocks, heroes through leveling and item acquisition.


This design borrows elements from:
- RTS games (resource management, unit control)
- MOBAs (hero-centric gameplay)
- Roguelikes (dungeon crawling, boss fights)
- Tower defense (fortification building)
