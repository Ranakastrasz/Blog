Based on the information provided, I can classify the Archer hero and its abilities as follows:

Class: Ranged Damage Dealer
Subclass: Single-target Specialist / Debuffer

Ability Classification:

1. Multishot: High single-target damage ability (Many individual hits)
2. Puncture: Debuff / Damage amplification ability
3. Steady: Self-buff ability (damage and range increase)
4. Marksmanship: Passive damage and attack speed enhancer
5. Arrow Rain (Ultimate): Area of Effect (AoE) damage and crowd control ability

Let's break down each ability:

1. Multishot:
   - High single-target burst damage
   - Unique armor interaction (more effective against lightly armored targets)
   - Best used against non-tank enemies or to finish off low-health targets

2. Puncture:
   - Debuff ability that increases target's vulnerability
   - Sets up high-damage combos for self and teammates
   - Requires good timing and target selection

3. Steady:
   - Self-buff that increases damage and range
   - Autocast feature allows for automatic optimization
   - Crucial for positioning and maximizing damage output

4. Marksmanship:
   - Passive ability that enhances basic attacks
   - Provides consistent damage increase throughout the game

5. Arrow Rain (Ultimate):
   - AoE damage ability with a slowing effect
   - Useful for team fights, area control, or clearing groups of enemies
   - Requires careful positioning due to channel time and travel time of arrows

Playstyle and Role:
The Archer is designed as a mid to long-range damage dealer with a focus on single-target elimination and team utility through debuffs. The hero excels at picking off lightly armored targets and setting up high-damage opportunities for the team.

Key Strengths:
1. High single-target damage potential (PowerShot + Puncture combo)
2. Ability to increase team's overall damage output (Puncture)
3. Flexibility in engagement range (Steady)
4. Consistent damage increase over time (Marksmanship)
5. AoE damage and crowd control for team fights (Arrow Rain)

Weaknesses:
1. Low HP and no armor make the Archer vulnerable
2. Reliance on abilities for maximum effectiveness
3. Less effective against heavily armored targets
4. Channeling abilities (Puncture, Arrow Rain) may leave Archer exposed

In a dungeon-style game, this Archer would excel at:
1. Quickly eliminating priority targets
2. Providing consistent damage from a safe distance
3. Setting up high-damage opportunities for the team
4. Controlling areas with Arrow Rain during key moments

The Archer would likely be most effective when paired with heroes who can protect them or take advantage of the Puncture debuff. This hero might struggle against heavily armored enemies or in close-quarters combat but would shine in situations where they can maintain optimal range and target priority enemies.
