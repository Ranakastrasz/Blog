   - Allows time for cooldowns and team assistance

Playstyle and Role:
The Wizard excels at area control, sustained damage output, and crowd control. They require careful positioning due to their fragility but have Ice Block as a last resort. Efficient mana management is crucial for optimal performance.

Key Strengths:
1. Strong area control and denial capabilities
2. Effective crowd control options
3. Sustained damage output with proper mana management
4. Ability to hit invisible or burrowed units
5. Versatility in spell usage for different situations
6. Ice Block provides a crucial survival mechanism

Weaknesses:
1. Low health and no armor make the Wizard very vulnerable (mitigated somewhat by Ice Block)
2. Heavily reliant on mana management
3. Some abilities (like Firewall) have cast times, requiring prediction
4. Can be overwhelmed if caught out of position

In a dungeon-style game, this Wizard would excel at:
1. Controlling key areas of the battlefield
2. Providing consistent damage and crowd control in team fights
3. Clearing waves of weaker enemies efficiently
4. Sieging fortifications with Tremor
5. Surviving focus fire or ambushes with Ice Block

The Wizard would likely be most effective when paired with tanky heroes who can protect them, allowing for maximum spell usage from a safe distance. This hero might struggle in close-quarters combat but has Ice Block as a last resort. The Wizard shines in situations where they can control the flow of battle from the backline, using a combination of area denial, crowd control, and sustained damage to support the team and hinder enemy movements.
