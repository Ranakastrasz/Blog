• Setting: My Little Pony historical era, three tribes period

Earth ponies, Unicorns, Pegasi segregated
Medieval tech level, some magic items (unicorn-made)
Setting focused on exploring slavery

• Social Structure:

Hierarchy: Unicorns (noble) > Pegasi (militant) > Earth ponies (laborers)
Earth pony Landlords as high-ranking elites and landowners
• Pony Physiology:

Earth ponies: Larger, stockier, stronger build
• Hooves for pushing and blunt manipulation
• Slight foreleg indentation near fetlock for pinching objects
• Rougher inner hoof edge for improved grip
• Lips, teeth, and tongue for object manipulation
Unicorns: Cloven hooves, thinner legs, lionine tails
• Physically weaker, more delicate
• Primary reliance on telekinesis
• Limited physical manipulation skills
Pegasi: Flexible, quick, agile
• Feathered fetlocks
• Wings provide additional dexterity
• Somewhat more delicate than earth ponies, but sturdier than unicorns
• Magic System:

Earth Pony Magic:
• Common knowledge that earth ponies have no magic. 
• Tied to agriculture, self-strengthening, regeneration, and health. Assumed to be biological traits. 
• Subtle and almost always unnoticed, even by earth ponies themselves.
• Enhances crop growth, land fertility, and physical endurance
• Contributes to earth ponies' superior strength and stamina
Pegasus Magic:
• Enables flight and cloud manipulation
• Allows walking on clouds and controlling weather patterns
• Weather control includes creating rain, snow, wind, and lightning
• Subtle magic enhances speed and agility in air and on ground
Unicorn Magic:
• Telekinesis as innate ability for all unicorns
• Spell-casting abilities limited by individual talent/cutie mark
• Enchanting as specialized skill for creating magical items
• Magic items rare and costly for non-unicorns
• Responsible for raising and lowering sun and moon via rituals
• Powerful spells may require sacrifices or risk magical backlash
• Sun/moon rituals exemplify sacrificial magic, draining casters over time
• Political Power Dynamics:

Unicorns: Sun/moon control via sacrificial rituals (magic-draining)
Pegasi: Weather control, drought threats
