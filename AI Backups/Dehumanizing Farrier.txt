Write a short story,  in which a human in Equestria, transformed into a pony, has to visit a farrier and get his new hooves shod. Emphasize the unnatural feeling state of being a pony, ears, tail, hooves, muzzle, being naked, having fur, the  discomfort and dehumanizing nature of the process, as well as the ache afterwards. 
Additionally, the farrier, without warning the former human, ties him down, fully restraining him to avoid bucking or other struggle while he uses hot and sharp implements. This is treated as normal, but the human is absolutely horrified and panicked.

The first thing I noticed was the fur. Soft yet slightly bristly, it covered every inch of my body. I felt the chill morning air creep through my coat, a sensation both foreign and strangely familiar. My ears twitched involuntarily at the sounds of birdsong and distant laughter, their newfound mobility disorienting. The weight of my tail swished back and forth, an appendage I could barely control.

The cobblestone street clacked beneath my hooves as I made my way to the farrier's shop, each step a reminder of my new reality. I glanced down, seeing four sturdy legs instead of two. The world felt unnaturally high and low at the same time. I wanted to reach out and touch my muzzle, reassure myself this was all a bad dream, but my new limbs were not designed for such a delicate task.

When I reached the farrier’s door, a bell chimed overhead. The scent of hot metal and hay filled my nostrils. Inside, a muscular earth pony looked up from his workbench, his eyes kind yet firm.

"Ah, you must be the new one," he said, wiping his hooves on a cloth. "Heard you needed some shoes."

I nodded, my throat dry. Speaking felt odd with my elongated muzzle, so I stayed silent. He gestured for me to follow him to a back room, where a strange-looking contraption awaited.

“Just a precaution,” he said, patting the wooden frame. “We don’t want you kicking about while I work.”

Before I could protest, he began strapping me in. Leather belts wrapped around my legs, pulling them tight against the frame. My heart pounded as he secured my torso and neck, leaving me completely immobilized. Panic surged through me, and I struggled against the restraints.

"Hey, hey, it's okay," he soothed, though his actions belied his words. "It’s normal. All ponies go through this."

My mind screamed in protest. This wasn't normal. This was a violation. But the farrier was already working, heating iron shoes in a forge, the glow of the metal casting an eerie light across the room.

The first touch of the hot shoe against my hoof sent a jolt of pain through my body. I tried to jerk away, but the restraints held me firm. The farrier hammered and filed, the clang of metal against metal echoing in my ears. Each blow resonated through my body, a harsh reminder of my new, fragile existence.

Tears welled in my eyes, more from the fear and helplessness than the pain. The process seemed to take forever, each minute an eternity of discomfort and humiliation. Finally, he stepped back, wiping sweat from his brow.

"All done," he said, unbuckling the straps. My legs trembled as I was released, my muscles aching from the strain. The shoes felt heavy and unnatural, a constant reminder of what I had become.

I stumbled out of the shop, each step sending a dull throb through my legs. The ache was profound, a deep, pulsing pain that settled into my bones. I felt dehumanized, reduced to something less than I once was. My fur itched, my tail flicked nervously, and my ears drooped.

The farrier had meant no harm. In his eyes, it was just another day, another pony shod. But for me, it was a nightmare, a harsh reality I had no choice but to endure. As I limped down the street, I couldn’t help but wonder if I would ever get used to this new life, or if the ache in my heart would ever fade.

Now write the same scene from the perspective of the farrier. Be detailed on exactly how he uses his blunt hooves and mouth to manipulate the tools, and mild annoyance at the struggling.

The bell above the door chimed, and I looked up from my workbench to see a nervous-looking pony standing in the entrance. Must be the new one everypony’s been talking about, the one who used to be a human. Poor thing looked like a colt in a storm, wide-eyed and jittery.

“Ah, you must be the new one,” I said, wiping my hooves on a cloth. “Heard you needed some shoes.”

The pony nodded but said nothing. I could see the tension in his posture, the way his ears flicked back and forth. Typical behavior for somepony not used to their new body. I gestured for him to follow me to the back room where I kept the shoeing frame.

“Just a precaution,” I said, patting the wooden structure. “We don’t want you kicking about while I work.”

I could see the hesitation in his eyes, but this was standard procedure. Better to be safe than sorry. I started strapping him in, securing his legs to the frame with well-worn leather belts. He began to struggle, pulling against the restraints. I sighed inwardly. This always made things more complicated.

“Hey, hey, it’s okay,” I said, trying to keep my voice soothing. “It’s normal. All ponies go through this.”

I fastened the last strap around his neck and stepped back, making sure everything was secure. He wasn’t going anywhere. I turned to my forge, where the iron shoes were heating. Picking up my tongs with my mouth, I carefully removed the first shoe and placed it on the anvil. I grabbed a hammer with my hoof, gripping the handle between the edge of my hoof and my pastern.

The first touch of the hot shoe to his hoof sent a jolt through him, and he tried to jerk away. I kept my focus, holding the shoe in place with the tongs while I hammered it into shape. The sound of metal on metal rang through the room, a familiar symphony to my ears.

“Hold still,” I muttered around the tongs. His struggling was starting to get on my nerves. Didn’t he know this was for his own good? I finished shaping the first shoe and dipped it into the water trough, steam hissing up in a cloud.

I repeated the process for the other three hooves, each time met with more struggling and muffled whimpers. It was hard work, especially with a pony that wouldn’t stay still. I had to use my weight to keep him steady, bracing his hoof against the anvil as I worked.

Finally, I was done. I stepped back, wiping sweat from my brow. “All done,” I said, unbuckling the straps. His legs trembled as he stood, clearly exhausted. I couldn’t blame him; it was a rough process for anypony, let alone someone not used to it.

“Take it easy for a bit,” I advised as he stumbled out of the shop. “You’ll get used to them.”

I watched him go, a pang of sympathy in my heart. Shoeing was never easy, and it was especially hard on those who weren’t born to it. But it was necessary. Those new hooves would protect him, keep him safe. He’d thank me someday, even if he didn’t understand it now.
