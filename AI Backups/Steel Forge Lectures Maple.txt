Write a short story, 2k+ words. Human in Equestria as a pony. Mark, now maple leaf, as he is physically incapable of saying his old name, has been here for almost 2 years. He has largely acclimated to being a pony, though involuntary movement of his ears and tail still remind him and feel wrong, the lack of fingers and dulled sensations from hus hooves, as does the occasional erection remind him that everypony is naked. Recently he has found his hooves have worn unevenly, making walking somewhat difficult, and moderately painful. He is sent to Steel Forge's, the local farrier. Steel forge, though professional, lectures Maple leaf on his lack of hoof care, and why pony shoes are so important. This is somewhere between why didn't your parents teach you this and why are ponies such idiots in tone, with a helping of condescension and talking to a child. Each hoof has to be placed on a post to keep it in place as it is filed and a horseshoe is nailed in place. While not painful, the pressure is alien, and the sensations from the vibration are somewhere between itchy and ticklish.
Be extremely detailed on exactly how a Pony with blunt hooves can still manipulate various tools using those hooves and their teeth and tounge. Also be extra detailed on how exactly it feels to be shod.

The Tale of Maple Leaf's First Shoeing
Mark, now known as Maple Leaf, had been a pony in Equestria for nearly two years. He'd acclimated to his new life, but certain aspects still felt jarring and alien. The involuntary flick of his ears, the swish of his tail, and the absence of fingers were constant reminders of his transformation. The dulled sensations from his hooves and the occasional awkwardness of public nudity only heightened his lingering sense of displacement.

Recently, he noticed his hooves had worn unevenly, causing discomfort and making walking somewhat difficult. Each step was a reminder of his changed body, and the pain underscored the need for proper hoof care, something he hadnâ€™t fully grasped yet.

With a sigh, Maple Leaf trotted to Steel Forge's workshop, the local farrier who was well-known for his expertise. The building was a modest structure made of sturdy wood and stone, the air around it tinged with the metallic scent of iron and the earthy aroma of hot coals. As he approached, the rhythmic clanging of metal echoed from within, accompanied by the occasional snort of a working pony.

"Maple Leaf, isn't it?" Steel Forge called out as he saw him approach. The burly earth pony, with his charcoal-colored coat and a mane streaked with silver, exuded an air of authority and competence. His cutie mark, a glowing horseshoe, gleamed in the light of the forge.

"Yes, that's me," Maple Leaf replied, a touch of apprehension in his voice.

"Come on in," Steel Forge gestured, his tone both welcoming and firm. "We need to take care of those hooves of yours."

Maple Leaf followed Steel Forge inside, where the heat from the forge enveloped him, and the myriad tools and equipment cluttered the walls and tables. An anvil sat prominently in the center, surrounded by various hoof care tools, ranging from files and rasps to hammers and nails.

Steel Forge motioned for Maple Leaf to step onto a wooden platform designed for easy access to hooves. As he complied, the farrier's sharp eyes scrutinized his hooves, taking in the uneven wear and minor cracks.

"You haven't been taking proper care of these, have you?" Steel Forge's voice carried a mix of disappointment and reprimand. "You ponies need to understand the importance of hoof care. It's not just about walking; it's about your overall well-being."

Maple Leaf felt a flush of embarrassment. "I didn't realize it was this important," he admitted.

Steel Forge shook his head, the condescension in his tone evident. "Why didn't your parents teach you this? Proper hoof care is essential, especially for a pony like you who seems to forget the basics. You need shoes, and you need to take care of them."

With a resigned nod, Maple Leaf lifted his left forehoof as directed. Steel Forge placed it on a hoof stand, a sturdy post designed to keep the hoof steady while he worked. The initial pressure of the post was foreign, making Maple Leaf's skin crawl slightly.

Steel Forge began by cleaning the hoof, using a hoof pick to remove any dirt and stones lodged in the frog and sole. Maple Leaf watched in fascination as the farrier deftly manipulated the tool using his hooves and teeth, demonstrating remarkable dexterity. The sensation was strange, the vibrations from the pick resonating through his leg in a way that was both itchy and ticklish.

Next, Steel Forge grabbed a rasp, a large, flat file designed for smoothing and shaping the hoof. He held it between his hooves, using his mouth to steady the tool and guide its movements. With practiced efficiency, he began filing the hoof, the rough surface grating against the hard keratin. Maple Leaf's hoof felt the rasp's coarse texture, the vibrations causing a mild discomfort that wasn't exactly painful but was distinctly alien.

"You see," Steel Forge began, his voice slightly muffled by the rasp in his mouth, "hoof care isn't just about aesthetics. Uneven wear can lead to lameness and other health issues. Proper trimming and shoeing distribute your weight evenly, preventing strain on your joints and muscles."

Maple Leaf nodded, wincing slightly as Steel Forge hit a particularly sensitive spot. "I understand. I'll be more careful."

Steel Forge grunted in response, his focus unwavering. Once the hoof was smooth and even, he moved to the next one, repeating the process with the same meticulous attention to detail. Each hoof felt the same peculiar mix of sensations: the scrape of the rasp, the vibrations traveling up his legs, and the mild itchiness that made him want to squirm.

After all four hooves were properly trimmed, Steel Forge selected a set of horseshoes from a rack. He placed one on the anvil and heated it in the forge until it glowed red-hot. Maple Leaf watched, both nervous and intrigued, as Steel Forge expertly hammered the shoe into shape, the metallic clang echoing through the workshop.

"This part might feel a bit strange," Steel Forge warned, positioning Maple Leaf's forehoof on the hoof stand again. He used tongs to hold the hot shoe, placing it against the hoof. The heat was intense but brief, searing away any remaining dirt and creating a perfect fit. Maple Leaf flinched at the sudden warmth but relaxed as the heat quickly dissipated.

Steel Forge then grabbed a set of nails and a hammer, holding each nail with his teeth and positioning them carefully around the edge of the shoe. With precise strikes, he hammered the nails into the hoof, the rhythmic pounding creating a peculiar sensation. Maple Leaf felt the vibrations more than the impact, each strike sending a resonant shiver through his leg.

"It's important to get the nails in just right," Steel Forge explained between hammer strikes. "Too deep, and it can cause pain or damage. Too shallow, and the shoe won't hold."

The farrier's expertise was evident in the way he handled each tool, his hooves and mouth working in perfect harmony. Despite their bluntness, his hooves manipulated the hammer and nails with surprising precision, using subtle shifts and angles to achieve the desired outcome. The process was slow and methodical, with each nail driven in at a specific angle to ensure a secure fit.

As Steel Forge worked, Maple Leaf's mind wandered. The experience was a stark reminder of his transformation, the sensations and procedures so far removed from anything he'd ever known as a human. Yet, there was something oddly satisfying about it, a sense of care and maintenance that felt deeply ingrained in his new pony identity.

Once all four hooves were shod, Steel Forge inspected his work, making minor adjustments and ensuring each shoe was secure. He then had Maple Leaf walk around the workshop, observing his gait and making sure the shoes were even and comfortable.

"How does it feel?" Steel Forge asked, his tone more neutral now.

Maple Leaf took a few tentative steps, getting used to the new sensation. The shoes felt strange but supportive, the even distribution of weight alleviating the discomfort he'd been feeling. "It feels... better," he admitted, a small smile forming. "Thank you."

Steel Forge nodded, a hint of satisfaction in his eyes. "Remember, proper hoof care is crucial. Check your hooves regularly, and don't hesitate to come back if you notice any issues. Your hooves are your foundation, and they need to be treated with care."

Maple Leaf left the workshop feeling a mixture of relief and newfound responsibility. The experience had been uncomfortable and strange, but it was a necessary step in his ongoing adaptation to life as a pony. As he walked through Ponyville, the sound of his newly shod hooves ringing against the cobblestones, he felt a sense of pride and acceptance.

He might never fully adjust to all the peculiarities of being a pony, but moments like this reminded him that he was capable of learning and growing in his new world. And with each step, he felt a little more at home in his own hooves.
