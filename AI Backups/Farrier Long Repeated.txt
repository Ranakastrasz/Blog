Write a short story, Human in Equestria as a pony. Mark, now maple leaf, as he is physically incapable of saying his old name, has been here for almost 2 years. He has largely acclimated to being a pony, though involuntary movement of his ears and tail still remind him and feel wrong, the lack of fingers and dulled sensations from hus hooves, as does the occasional erection remind him that everypony is naked. Recently he has found his hooves have worn unevenly, making walking somewhat difficult, and moderately painful. He is sent to Steel Forge's, the local farrier. Steel forge, though professional, lectures Maple leaf on his lack of hoof care, and why pony shoes are so important. This is somewhere between why didn't your parents teach you this and why are ponies such idiots in tone, with a helping of condescension and talking to a child. Each hoof has to be placed on a post to keep it in place as it is filed and a horseshoe is nailed in place. While not painful, the pressure is alien, and the sensations from the vibration are somewhere between itchy and ticklish.
Be extremely detailed on exactly how a Pony with blunt hooves can still manipulate various tools using those hooves and their teeth and tonge. Also be extra detailed on how exactly it feels to be shod.

Repeat from the perspective of the farrier. Include detail on exactly how he shifts to hold the tools, passing from between hoof and pasturn to mouth, or gripping wirh teeth. The farrier has no knowledge of the transformation. Mentally express disappointment in maple leaf's lack of hoof care, and how it feels like ponies don't really seem to care until something actually causes problems.
Be extremely detailed in all aspects of the story, so as to better allow a reader to immerse themselves in the perspective of the characters. Use first person view.

Maple Leaf's Perspective
I trotted gingerly towards Steel Forge's smithy, each step sending a sharp reminder of my neglected hooves. Nearly two years in Equestria, and I still found myself stumbling over basic pony care. The involuntary twitch of my ears and the swish of my tail, once novel, now felt like reminders of my strange new reality. My tail flicked involuntarily again, a subtle betrayal of my discomfort.

The smell of hot metal and burning coal grew stronger as I approached, the rhythmic clang of Steel Forge’s hammer a constant backdrop. I nudged the door open with my muzzle, the bell above tinkling to announce my arrival. Steel Forge looked up from his anvil, his steely blue eyes locking onto mine.

“Ah, Maple Leaf,” he greeted, his tone already dripping with a mix of professionalism and thinly veiled condescension. “You’re late for your appointment. Come, let’s see those hooves.”

I walked over, lifting each hoof awkwardly as he inspected them. His brow furrowed deeper with each hoof he examined. “These are in poor shape, Maple. Haven’t you been taught proper hoof care? This isn’t something to neglect. Shoes are essential for maintaining hoof health, especially for ponies like you who seem to... not understand their importance.”

I opened my mouth to retort, but quickly shut it. How could I explain my lack of knowledge without revealing my human past? I nodded mutely instead, feeling a flush of embarrassment warm my cheeks.

Steel Forge motioned to a wooden post, clearly designed to keep a hoof in place during work. “Place your right front hoof here. We’ll start with this one.”

I complied, placing my hoof on the post. Steel Forge picked up a hoof knife with his teeth, his movements precise and practiced. He shifted the knife to his hoof, expertly balancing it as he began to trim the overgrown edges of my hoof. The sensation was strange—an odd mix of pressure and the faintest hint of an itch as the blade scraped away the dead material.

Next, he moved to a rasp, a long, flat file that he held between his hooves, dragging it rhythmically across my hoof to smooth the edges. The vibrations were disconcerting, sending tingles up my leg that were almost ticklish. I had to fight the urge to pull my hoof back.

“Keep still,” Steel Forge admonished, pausing to reposition the rasp. “If you’ve been neglecting your hooves, this will feel unusual. But it’s necessary.”

After what felt like an eternity, he finished filing and reached for the horseshoes. They were simple, curved pieces of metal, but the sight of them made my heart race. He balanced one on my hoof, adjusting it with small taps of a hammer he held deftly in his teeth. The first nail was driven in with a quick, precise blow. It didn’t hurt, but the pressure was alien, a firm insistence that something was being permanently attached to me.

Each subsequent nail sent vibrations through my hoof, the sensation crawling up my leg like a persistent itch. I bit my lip, trying to focus on anything but the strange feeling. When he finally finished, I gingerly placed my hoof back on the ground. It felt... different. More stable, but undeniably strange.

“One down, three to go,” Steel Forge said, moving to my next hoof. The process repeated, each hoof receiving the same meticulous attention. By the time he was done, I felt exhausted, my legs trembling slightly from the unfamiliar sensations.

“Remember, Maple Leaf,” Steel Forge said as I turned to leave, “take better care of your hooves. Proper maintenance is crucial. Don’t wait until it’s a problem next time.”

I nodded, thanking him as I stepped out of the smithy. The horseshoes clinked softly against the cobblestone path, a constant reminder of the care I needed to learn. The experience had been uncomfortable, but necessary. As I walked away, I resolved to take better care of myself, to learn the intricacies of pony life that still eluded me. After all, this was my life now, and it was high time I truly embraced it.

Steel Forge's Perspective
I glanced up as the bell above the door jingled, announcing Maple Leaf’s arrival. He was late, again. I sighed inwardly, setting down my hammer and wiping the sweat from my brow. Another pony neglecting their hoof care until it became a problem. It was a trend I saw far too often.

“Ah, Maple Leaf,” I greeted, keeping my tone as professional as possible despite my frustration. “You’re late for your appointment. Come, let’s see those hooves.”

Maple Leaf approached, lifting each hoof awkwardly. As I examined them, I couldn’t help but frown. The uneven wear and overgrown edges were a clear sign of neglect. Didn’t these ponies understand how important hoof care was? I had half a mind to lecture him right there and then.

“These are in poor shape, Maple. Haven’t you been taught proper hoof care? This isn’t something to neglect. Shoes are essential for maintaining hoof health, especially for ponies like you who seem to... not understand their importance.”

He looked embarrassed, but said nothing. I shook my head slightly and motioned to the wooden post. “Place your right front hoof here. We’ll start with this one.”

He complied, and I picked up my hoof knife with my teeth. The familiar weight and balance of the tool were comforting as I shifted it to my hoof, using a practiced grip to begin trimming the overgrown edges. Each scrape of the blade was deliberate, removing the dead material efficiently. I glanced up occasionally to ensure Maple was holding still.

Once the trimming was done, I switched to the rasp. Holding it between my hooves, I began to file the hoof, smoothing the edges. The vibrations from the rasp traveled through my hooves, a sensation I was long accustomed to but knew would feel strange to Maple. Sure enough, he twitched slightly.

“Keep still,” I admonished, repositioning the rasp. “If you’ve been neglecting your hooves, this will feel unusual. But it’s necessary.”

After finishing the filing, I reached for the horseshoes. Selecting one that fit Maple’s hoof, I balanced it carefully and held a nail between my teeth, positioning it with precision. A quick blow with the hammer, held firmly in my mouth, drove the nail in. The pressure was firm but not painful, designed to attach the shoe securely without causing discomfort.

Each nail was driven in with the same care, the vibrations from the hammer blows traveling up through Maple’s hoof. I watched for any signs of discomfort, but he seemed to handle it well enough. Once the shoe was secured, I moved to the next hoof, repeating the process with the same meticulous attention.

As I worked, I couldn’t help but feel a pang of disappointment. Why did so many ponies wait until their hooves were in such poor condition? It was as if they didn’t care until it caused them pain. Proper maintenance was crucial, yet it seemed to be the last thing on their minds.

Finally, the last shoe was in place. Maple Leaf stepped back, testing the feel of the new shoes. I could see the difference immediately—his stance was more stable, his movements more confident.

“Remember, Maple Leaf,” I said, meeting his eyes, “take better care of your hooves. Proper maintenance is crucial. Don’t wait until it’s a problem next time.”

He nodded, thanking me before leaving the smithy. As the door closed behind him, I turned back to my forge, the rhythmic clang of metal on metal resuming. Another pony helped, another lesson hopefully learned. All I could do was continue my work, one hoof at a time.

Repeat as a new appointment, 6 months later. Include the sheer wrongness maple feels over his hoof being cut into to remove the old, worn horseshoe, even if it doesn't hurt, and is arguably no different from a fingernail. Both maple and steel Forge's perspective. Forge is less annoyed this time, because maple is actually on time.

Maple Leaf's Perspective
Six months had passed since my last visit to Steel Forge, and I had made a point to take better care of my hooves. Yet, as I approached the smithy again, a familiar sense of apprehension settled over me. The experience of being shod had been strange and uncomfortable, and the thought of it happening again made my skin crawl.

I nudged the door open with my muzzle, the bell tinkling to announce my arrival. Steel Forge looked up from his anvil, his eyes meeting mine with a hint of surprise.

“On time this time, Maple Leaf,” he noted, a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. “Let’s see those hooves.”

I stepped forward, lifting each hoof for his inspection. He nodded approvingly. “Better. You’ve been taking care of them. But it’s time for new shoes.”

I moved to the wooden post, placing my right front hoof on it as instructed. Steel Forge picked up his hoof knife, and a wave of unease washed over me. The sensation of the blade cutting into my hoof to remove the old shoe, while not painful, felt deeply wrong. It was like watching someone cut into a fingernail—harmless, yet unsettling.

Steel Forge worked efficiently, using his teeth and hooves to manipulate the tools with practiced ease. The knife slipped under the edge of the old shoe, and he pried it off with a deft twist. The sensation was bizarre, a tugging and pressure that sent shivers up my leg.

“Keep still,” Steel Forge murmured, not unkindly. “It’ll be over soon.”

The knife moved with precision, scraping away the remnants of old material. The vibrations were just as disconcerting as I remembered, a mix of ticklish and itchy that made me want to pull away. But I held still, knowing it was necessary.

Once the old shoe was off, Steel Forge switched to the rasp, filing my hoof smooth. The rasping sound and the vibrations it sent through my hoof were almost too much, but I focused on keeping still. When he finally picked up a new horseshoe, I felt a strange mix of relief and apprehension.

Steel Forge positioned the new shoe, holding it steady with his hoof as he picked up a nail with his teeth. The first blow of the hammer sent a familiar, uncomfortable pressure through my hoof. Each subsequent nail felt the same, a firm insistence that something was being attached to me. It didn’t hurt, but it was undeniably strange.

When he finished, I placed my hoof back on the ground, testing the new shoe. It felt different, but more comfortable than the worn one. We repeated the process with the remaining hooves, each one bringing a fresh wave of discomfort but also a sense of stability once the new shoe was in place.

“You’re done,” Steel Forge said, stepping back. “You did well, Maple Leaf. Keep up with the hoof care, and you’ll find these visits less uncomfortable.”

I nodded, thanking him as I left the smithy. The clink of the new shoes against the cobblestones was a reassuring sound, a reminder that I was taking better care of myself. The experience had been unsettling, but necessary, and I resolved to continue improving my hoof care.

Steel Forge's Perspective
I glanced up as the bell above the door jingled, and was pleasantly surprised to see Maple Leaf arrive on time for once. I set down my hammer and wiped the sweat from my brow, nodding in greeting.

“On time this time, Maple Leaf,” I noted with a hint of approval. “Let’s see those hooves.”

He approached and lifted each hoof for my inspection. They were in much better condition than last time. I nodded approvingly. “Better. You’ve been taking care of them. But it’s time for new shoes.”

Maple moved to the wooden post, placing his right front hoof on it. I picked up my hoof knife, noticing the slight tension in his posture. Removing the old shoe was always unsettling for ponies, especially those new to proper hoof care. The knife slipped under the edge of the old shoe, and I pried it off with a deft twist. The hoof moved slightly, but Maple held still.

“Keep still,” I murmured, focusing on my task. The knife scraped away the remnants of the old material, the vibrations traveling through my hooves as well. I could see the discomfort in Maple’s eyes, but he stayed still, knowing it was necessary.

Once the old shoe was off, I switched to the rasp. Holding it between my hooves, I began to file the hoof smooth. The rasping sound filled the room, and I could see Maple struggling to stay still. The vibrations were always disconcerting, especially for those not used to them.

When the hoof was smooth, I picked up a new horseshoe, balancing it carefully on Maple’s hoof. Holding a nail between my teeth, I positioned it with precision and delivered the first blow with the hammer. The nail drove in cleanly, the pressure firm but not painful.

Each subsequent nail went in with the same care,

Maple Leaf's Perspective
The sharp pain in my hoof had been getting worse over the past few days. What started as a dull ache had quickly escalated into something far more alarming. I knew something was wrong, and all my efforts to care for my hooves seemed futile against this persistent, throbbing pain. It was with a sense of urgency and growing concern that I made my way to Steel Forge's smithy, hoping he could help.

The bell above the door tinkled as I entered, and Steel Forge looked up from his work. His expression shifted from surprise to concern as he saw the strain on my face.

“Maple Leaf, you’re early,” he noted, setting down his tools. “What’s wrong?”

“I think there’s something seriously wrong with my hoof,” I admitted, lifting my front hoof gingerly. “It’s been hurting a lot.”

Steel Forge’s face grew serious as he examined my hoof. “Let’s get you on the post and take a closer look.”

I moved to the wooden post, wincing as I placed my hoof on it. Steel Forge inspected it carefully, his practiced eyes quickly identifying the problem.

“You have an abscess, Maple. It’s causing that pain. We need to drain it and clean it out.”

My heart sank. I had heard about hoof abscesses and knew they could be painful, but experiencing it firsthand was another matter entirely. Steel Forge’s calm demeanor was somewhat reassuring, but the idea of what needed to be done filled me with dread.

He picked up a hoof knife and a pair of hoof nippers, his movements precise and practiced. “This will be uncomfortable, but it’s necessary to relieve the pressure and start the healing process.”

The nippers clamped down on the edge of my hoof, and the pressure sent a wave of pain through my leg. I bit my lip, trying to stay still as Steel Forge worked. The sensation of the nippers cutting into my hoof was a disturbing mix of wrongness and discomfort. It felt deeply unnatural, even though I knew it was necessary.

Steel Forge worked quickly, using the nippers to expose the abscess. When he finally made the cut, a rush of fluid escaped, and the relief was almost immediate. The intense pressure that had been building up inside my hoof dissipated, replaced by a dull throb.

“Keep still,” Steel Forge instructed, his tone gentle but firm. “We need to clean this out thoroughly.”

He switched to a hoof knife, carefully cleaning the area around the abscess. The vibrations and scraping sensations were unsettling, but the pain was much more manageable now. I focused on keeping still, knowing that the worst was over.

Once the area was cleaned, Steel Forge applied an antiseptic and wrapped my hoof with a protective bandage. “This will help keep it clean and promote healing. You’ll need to keep it dry and avoid too much pressure on it for the next few days.”

I nodded, feeling a mix of relief and exhaustion. “Thank you, Steel Forge. I’ll do my best to take care of it.”

“You’ve been doing well with your hoof care,” he said, a hint of encouragement in his voice. “Just keep an eye on it and come back if you notice any changes.”

I thanked him again as I left the smithy, feeling the gentle throb in my hoof with each step. The experience had been painful and unsettling, but I was grateful for Steel Forge’s expertise and care. As I made my way home, I resolved to be even more vigilant with my hoof care, knowing that it was crucial for my well-being.

Steel Forge's Perspective
The bell above the door tinkled, and I looked up to see Maple Leaf entering, his face etched with pain and worry. He was early, which immediately set off alarm bells in my mind. Something was wrong.

“Maple Leaf, you’re early,” I noted, setting down my tools. “What’s wrong?”

“I think there’s something seriously wrong with my hoof,” he admitted, lifting his front hoof gingerly. “It’s been hurting a lot.”

My concern grew as I examined his hoof. It didn’t take long to identify the problem. “You have an abscess, Maple. It’s causing that pain. We need to drain it and clean it out.”

He looked understandably apprehensive. Hoof abscesses could be incredibly painful, but addressing them promptly was crucial. I grabbed my hoof knife and a pair of hoof nippers, preparing to relieve the pressure and start the healing process.

“This will be uncomfortable, but it’s necessary to relieve the pressure and start the healing process,” I explained, hoping to reassure him.

The nippers clamped down on the edge of his hoof, and I saw Maple tense up. The pressure was necessary to expose the abscess, and when I made the cut, a rush of fluid escaped. The relief on Maple’s face was immediate, even though the process was undoubtedly painful.

“Keep still,” I instructed, focusing on cleaning the area around the abscess. Using the hoof knife, I carefully removed any remaining debris and cleaned the wound thoroughly. The vibrations and scraping sensations were always unsettling, but they were necessary to ensure proper healing.

Once the area was clean, I applied an antiseptic and wrapped Maple’s hoof with a protective bandage. “This will help keep it clean and promote healing. You’ll need to keep it dry and avoid too much pressure on it for the next few days.”

He nodded, looking relieved but exhausted. “Thank you, Steel Forge. I’ll do my best to take care of it.”

“You’ve been doing well with your hoof care,” I said, offering some encouragement. “Just keep an eye on it and come back if you notice any changes.”

As Maple left the smithy, I watched him carefully. The experience had been painful for him, but addressing the abscess promptly was crucial. I hoped he would continue to take good care of his hooves and avoid such issues in the future. As I returned to my work, I reminded myself that every pony had to learn the importance of hoof care, sometimes the hard way. But with each visit, I hoped they’d take those lessons to heart.

Another appointment, but this one by rainbow dash. And by appointment, I mean Applejack tying rainbow up and dragging her to the farrier, and rainbow struggling to escape, not wanting her overly sensitive hooves touched. Nonetheless, she gets shod, flinching at every touch and trying to struggle away at the sensations.

Rainbow Dash's Perspective
I was fuming as Applejack dragged me toward Steel Forge's smithy. She had tied my wings and legs with a sturdy rope, leaving me no room to escape. "Applejack, this is so uncool!" I protested, struggling against the restraints. "I don't need new horseshoes!"

"Ya do need new shoes, Dash, and yer gonna get 'em whether ya like it or not," Applejack replied firmly, not slowing her pace.

The bell above the door tinkled as Applejack shoved the door open, practically dragging me inside. Steel Forge looked up, eyebrows raised at the sight of a bound and struggling Rainbow Dash.

"Applejack, what's going on?" he asked, clearly surprised.

"Rainbow here don't wanna get her hooves done, but they're in bad shape. Thought a visit to you would do her some good," Applejack explained, tightening her grip on the rope.

Steel Forge sighed, clearly understanding the situation. "Alright, let's get this over with. Rainbow, you need to calm down. It won't be as bad as you think."

I glared at him, still struggling. "My hooves are fine! Just let me go!"

But it was no use. Applejack forced me onto the wooden post, holding me steady as Steel Forge approached with his tools. The moment his hoof nippers touched my hoof, I flinched, trying to pull away.

"Stay still, Rainbow," Steel Forge said, his tone firm but calm. "I know it's uncomfortable, but it'll be over soon."

The nippers clamped down, and the pressure sent a jolt up my leg. Every touch felt magnified, the vibrations and scraping sensations making me want to leap out of my skin. I clenched my teeth, trying to endure it, but each movement of the nippers and rasp felt like torture.

Steel Forge worked quickly, but every moment felt like an eternity. My overly sensitive hooves made each touch unbearable, and I flinched at every tool that came near me. Applejack held me steady, her strength the only thing keeping me in place.

Finally, the old shoe was off, but the process wasn't over. Steel Forge began cleaning and filing my hoof, and I struggled to stay still. The rasping sound and the vibrations it sent through my hoof were almost too much. My body tensed with every stroke, my muscles straining against the ropes.

"Just a bit longer, Rainbow," Steel Forge said, his voice a mixture of patience and determination.

When he finally positioned the new horseshoe, I felt a moment of relief, quickly replaced by more discomfort as he began nailing it in place. Each blow of the hammer sent a wave of pressure through my hoof, and I couldn't help but flinch with every nail.

By the time all four hooves were done, I was exhausted and my nerves felt frayed. Applejack finally released the ropes, and I stepped back, testing the new shoes. They felt strange but secure, the pain and discomfort slowly fading.

"There, see? That wasn't so bad," Applejack said with a smirk.

I shot her a glare. "Next time, I'm flying out of here before you can tie me up."

Steel Forge chuckled, shaking his head. "Just take better care of your hooves, Rainbow. It’ll make the whole process easier next time."

I huffed, but deep down I knew he was right. As we left the smithy, I resolved to take better care of my hooves, if only to avoid another visit like this one.

Steel Forge's Perspective
The bell above the door jingled, and I looked up to see Applejack practically dragging a bound and struggling Rainbow Dash into the smithy. I raised an eyebrow at the sight, setting down my tools.

"Applejack, what's going on?" I asked, surprised by the scene.

"Rainbow here don't wanna get her hooves done, but they're in bad shape. Thought a visit to you would do her some good," Applejack explained, holding the ropes tightly.

I sighed, understanding the situation. Rainbow Dash was known for her stubbornness, but her hooves did need attention. "Alright, let's get this over with. Rainbow, you need to calm down. It won't be as bad as you think."

Rainbow glared at me, still struggling against the restraints. "My hooves are fine! Just let me go!"

But Applejack held her steady as I approached with my tools. The moment my hoof nippers touched Rainbow's hoof, she flinched, trying to pull away.

"Stay still, Rainbow," I said firmly. "I know it's uncomfortable, but it'll be over soon."

The nippers clamped down, and I felt her tense up. I worked quickly, removing the old shoe with as much care as possible. Each touch seemed to send jolts through her, and she flinched at every movement. The vibrations and scraping sensations were clearly unbearable for her, but we had to get through this.

Once the old shoe was off, I began cleaning and filing her hoof. Holding the rasp between my hooves, I worked with precision, aware of how sensitive her hooves were. The rasping sound and the vibrations made her struggle even more, but Applejack kept her steady.

"Just a bit longer, Rainbow," I said, trying to reassure her. I knew this was difficult for her, but it was necessary.

When I finally positioned the new horseshoe, I felt a moment of relief, quickly replaced by more discomfort for Rainbow as I began nailing it in place. Each blow of the hammer sent a wave of pressure through her hoof, and she flinched with every nail.

After finishing all four hooves, I stepped back, watching as Applejack released the ropes. Rainbow tested the new shoes, her stance more stable despite the discomfort.

"There, see? That wasn't so bad," Applejack said with a smirk.

Rainbow shot her a glare. "Next time, I'm flying out of here before you can tie me up."

I chuckled, shaking my head. "Just take better care of your hooves, Rainbow. It’ll make the whole process easier next time."

As they left the smithy, I returned to my work, hoping that Rainbow would heed my advice. It was always a challenge dealing with stubborn ponies, but with proper care, their hooves—and their experiences—could be much better.

Repeat, but detail each of the four hooves, rather than glossing over the latter 3. After the first, have rainbows hoof be tied down, and untied after it is done, before repeating for the remaining two. For the last two, rear hooves, rainbow tries to buck, but lacks the leverage to do so. Also, steel forge doesn't think about rainbows hooves being sensitive, but rather rainbow being uncooperative like a little foal.

Finally, the old shoe was off, but the process wasn't over. Steel Forge began cleaning and filing my hoof, and I struggled to stay still. The rasping sound and the vibrations it sent through my hoof were almost too much. My body tensed with every stroke, my muscles straining against the ropes.

"Just a bit longer, Rainbow," Steel Forge said, his voice a mixture of patience and determination.

When he finally positioned the new horseshoe, I felt a moment of relief, quickly replaced by more discomfort as he began nailing it in place. Each blow of the hammer sent a wave of pressure through my hoof, and I couldn't help but flinch with every nail.

Applejack untied my ropes after the first hoof was done, and I staggered back, relieved to have some freedom. But it was short-lived. She quickly tied down my second front hoof, and the process repeated. This time, my struggle intensified, but I lacked the leverage to buck effectively against Applejack's hold. Steel Forge worked methodically, seemingly oblivious to my discomfort, treating me like a stubborn foal rather than acknowledging my sensitive hooves.

By the time my front hooves were done, I was exhausted and my nerves felt raw. Applejack moved to my rear hooves, and I knew what was coming. As she tied down my left rear hoof, I tried to buck again, but it was futile. Steel Forge began working on it, his movements just as efficient and oblivious to my discomfort.

The rasp scraped against my hoof, sending shivers up my leg. I gritted my teeth, trying to endure the sensation. When the new shoe was finally in place, I braced myself for the last rear hoof. Applejack tied it down securely, and I struggled once more against the ropes, feeling trapped and helpless.

Steel Forge worked on my final hoof, his manner unyielding. The vibrations and pressure were unbearable, and I couldn't help but flinch and squirm. Each touch felt like an eternity until finally, the last shoe was secured.

Applejack released the ropes, and I staggered back, testing the new shoes cautiously. They felt strange but secure, the pain and discomfort slowly fading. As I glared at Applejack, she smirked triumphantly.

"There, see? That wasn't so bad," she teased.

I shot her a glare, too drained to argue further. Steel Forge chuckled, shaking his head.

"Just take better care of your hooves, Rainbow," he said, a hint of amusement in his voice. "It’ll make the whole process easier next time."

I huffed, but deep down I knew he was right. As we left the smithy, I resolved to take better care of my hooves, if only to avoid another visit like this one.

Steel Forge's Perspective
The bell above the door jingled, and I looked up to see Applejack practically dragging a bound and struggling Rainbow Dash into the smithy. I raised an eyebrow at the sight, setting down my tools.

"Applejack, what's going on?" I asked, surprised by the scene.

"Rainbow here don't wanna get her hooves done, but they're in bad shape. Thought a visit to you would do her some good," Applejack explained, holding the ropes tightly.

I sighed, understanding the situation. Rainbow Dash was known for her stubbornness, but her hooves did need attention. "Alright, let's get this over with. Rainbow, you need to calm down. It won't be as bad as you think."

Rainbow glared at me, still struggling against the restraints. "My hooves are fine! Just let me go!"

But Applejack held her steady as I approached with my tools. The moment my hoof nippers touched Rainbow's hoof, she flinched, trying to pull away.

"Stay still, Rainbow," I said firmly. "I know it's uncomfortable, but it'll be over soon."

The nippers clamped down, and I felt her tense up. I worked quickly, removing the old shoe with as much care as possible. Each touch seemed to send jolts through her, and she flinched at every movement. The vibrations and scraping sensations were clearly unbearable for her, but we had to get through this.

Once the old shoe was off, I began cleaning and filing her hoof. Holding the rasp between my hooves, I worked with precision, aware of how stubborn Rainbow could be. The rasping sound and the vibrations made her struggle even more, but Applejack kept her steady.

"Just a bit longer, Rainbow," I said, trying to reassure her. I knew this was difficult for her, but it was necessary.

When I finally positioned the new horseshoe, I felt a moment of relief, quickly replaced by more discomfort for Rainbow as I began nailing it in place. Each blow of the hammer sent a wave of pressure through her hoof, and she flinched with every nail.

Applejack untied my ropes after the first hoof was done, and Rainbow staggered back, clearly relieved to have some freedom. But it was short-lived. She struggled against the ropes as Applejack tied down her second front hoof, and the process repeated. I worked through it methodically, focusing on the task at hand despite her resistance.

By the time her front hooves were done, I could sense her exhaustion. Applejack moved to her rear hooves, and I prepared for more resistance. As she tied down Rainbow's left rear hoof, I saw her attempt to buck, but it was futile against Applejack's hold. I continued my work, scraping and filing her hoof with the same efficiency, mentally noting her uncooperative behavior.

The rasp scraped against her hoof, sending shivers up her leg. She gritted her teeth, trying to endure the sensation. When the new shoe was finally in place, I moved on to the last rear hoof. Applejack tied it down securely, and I could see Rainbow struggling once more against the ropes.

I worked through the final hoof, my manner unyielding despite her discomfort. The vibrations and pressure were undeniable, and I completed the shoeing with the same efficiency as the others. Applejack released the ropes, and Rainbow staggered back, clearly drained from the ordeal.

As I watched them leave the smithy, I hoped Rainbow would take my advice to heart. Proper hoof care was crucial, and while her resistance had made this visit challenging, I knew it was ultimately for her own good. I returned to my work, knowing that every pony had their own challenges, but with patience and persistence, we could ensure their well-being.

12 months later, after rainbow loses one of her horseshoes due to an aged, now rusty nail, Applejack captures her again, forces her into a gimp suit, leaving only her tail, ears, and nose exposed. Usage of extra straps makes restraining her much easier while she is shod again, rendering even her strongest struggles entirely impotent. Steel forge is largely amused by the situation, while rainbow dash is panicked, unable to open her wings, move more than a few inches, or even speak or see. Here ears twitch constantly trying to keep track of things so she can anticipate her hooves being touched, but it is still a surprise almost every time.
